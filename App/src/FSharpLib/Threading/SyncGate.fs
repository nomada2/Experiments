(*To use this implementation of SyncGate from an asynchronous workflow, you call BeginRegion passing Shared or Exclusive with the keyword use!. The thread from which BeginRegion is called is returned to the ThreadPool. When the lock becomes available, the continuation is queued to the ThreadPool for execution. That's where the rest of the workflow picks up. When the identifier you bound to the return value of BeginRegion goes out of scope, Dispose and thus EndRegion gets called automatically. If you need more control over when EndRegion gets called, you could bind with let! instead of use!.*)
